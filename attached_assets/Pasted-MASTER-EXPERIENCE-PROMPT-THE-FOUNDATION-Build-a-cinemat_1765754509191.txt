MASTER EXPERIENCE PROMPT (THE FOUNDATION)

Build a cinematic, luxury digital experience for a high-end restaurant in Oran, Algeria (P922+7XX, Rue Patrice Lumumba).

The website should feel like:

A film opening, not a webpage

Calm, confident, expensive

Designed for people who appreciate quality and atmosphere

Every interaction must feel intentional, slow, and premium.
No generic UI patterns.

💰 Value: Brand strategy + UX philosophy

2️⃣ CINEMATIC OPENING SEQUENCE (THIS ALONE IS $10K)

Create a cinematic intro sequence:

Black screen

Soft ambient sound (optional toggle)

Fade into a Sketchfab 3D luxury interior

Camera slowly drifting

Restaurant name appears letter by letter using anime.js

Subtle grain + vignette

Allow user to “Enter Experience”

💰 Value: High-end storytelling & emotional hook

3️⃣ ARCHITECTURAL SCROLL (BIG MONEY FEATURE)

Implement architectural scrolling:

Scrolling feels like moving through physical space

Sections overlap slightly

Depth layering (foreground / mid / background)

Text moves slower than visuals (parallax restraint)

No harsh snapping. Everything floats.

💰 Value: Advanced motion design

4️⃣ 3D AS A CHARACTER, NOT A DECORATION

Treat the Sketchfab 3D scene as a living presence:

3D scene reacts subtly to scroll

Lighting feels warm at first, deeper later

Camera movement synced to user progression

The 3D should support the story, not dominate it.

💰 Value: Narrative 3D integration

5️⃣ LUXURY TYPOGRAPHY SYSTEM

Design a typography system:

Serif for emotion (headlines)

Sans-serif for clarity (body)

Large breathing space

Text never rushes onto screen

Text appears like it’s being revealed, not loaded.

💰 Value: Editorial design

6️⃣ MENU AS AN EXPERIENCE (NOT A LIST)

Present the menu like a gallery:

Each dish is introduced slowly

Hover reveals story, ingredients, origin

Gentle light sweep animation on cards

No prices shown initially — focus on desire first.

💰 Value: Luxury conversion psychology

7️⃣ INVISIBLE MICRO-INTERACTIONS

Add micro-interactions that are almost invisible:

Buttons slightly warm on hover

Soft scale shift on click

Cursor proximity glow (very subtle)

Nothing flashy. Everything controlled.

💰 Value: Perceived craftsmanship

8️⃣ “SILENCE IS LUXURY” PERFORMANCE PROMPT

Optimize performance so:

Animations are GPU-friendly

Motion pauses when user stops scrolling

Idle state has slow ambient movement

The site should feel calm, not busy.

💰 Value: High-end engineering

9️⃣ LOCATION AS PRESTIGE (ORAN IDENTITY)

Integrate Oran subtly:

Mediterranean color warmth

Cultural confidence (no clichés)

Address treated like a signature:
“P922+7XX, Rue Patrice Lumumba, Oran”

Oran should feel important.

💰 Value: Place-based branding

🔟 RESERVATION AS A RITUAL

Design reservation flow as a ritual:

Minimal form

Smooth step transitions

Confirmation feels ceremonial

User feels chosen, not processed.

💰 Value: Luxury UX psychology

1️⃣1️⃣ OWNER MODE (THIS SELLS THE $50K)

Add a hidden “Owner Mode”:

Toggle animations on/off

Change hero text

Update menu items

Swap Sketchfab model ID

No backend required, frontend controls only.

💰 Value: Longevity & control

1️⃣2️⃣ FINAL POLISH PROMPT (AGENCY-LEVEL)

Apply final polish:

Perfect easing curves

No default Tailwind feel

Consistent spacing rhythm

Everything feels custom, bespoke, intentional

💰 Value: The difference between $5k and $50k

🧠 REALITY CHECK (IMPORTANT)

A $50,000 website is:

30% visuals

30% motion

20% psychology

20% restraint

NOT:
❌ More features
❌ Faster animations
❌ Flashy effects
